# KeshSecureFiles



Project Overview:

KeshSecureFiles is a secure file management software designed to protect users' digital assets through robust encryption and password protection features. The application ensures the confidentiality and integrity of files by employing advanced cryptographic algorithms and user authentication mechanisms.

Example:

Imagine you have sensitive documents, such as financial records or personal journals, that you want to safeguard from unauthorized access. With KeshSecureFiles, you can easily encrypt these files using a strong password. Once encrypted, the files become inaccessible to anyone without the correct password, ensuring that your confidential information remains secure. You can organize your encrypted files into categories, such as "Finance," "Personal," or "Work," for convenient management and retrieval.


Upcoming Enhancements:

Transition from password-based security to a combination of USB key and password authentication for enhanced security.
Enhance the user interface with animations and visual effects to improve user experience and engagement.
Improve file encryption by splitting encrypted files into multiple parts scattered across a directory to enhance encryption strength.
Implement automatic deletion of encrypted files after five consecutive incorrect password attempts to prevent unauthorized access.
Introduce a password strength indicator to guide users in creating stronger and more secure passwords.
Incorporate personal security questions, such as "What is the name of your pet?" or "Where were you born?" during setup to verify the user's identity and enhance security measures.
Explore additional enhancements and features to further enhance the security and usability of KeshSecureFiles.
These planned enhancements aim to elevate the security and functionality of KeshSecureFiles, providing users with an even more robust and reliable solution for protecting their sensitive files.
